# RWB
RWB means read, write blogsite
RWB is an exciting project aiming to provide users with a platform to read, write, and blog across various genres. With its user-friendly interface, interactive features, and administrator controls. It has an authentication system to verify users and guests. First, you need to sign up for your real email account, and you will get a verification email with a verification link. You need to click that link to verify your email account.
If you don't want to verify your account, I provide guest mode so that you can get access to see public posts but not private posts.
